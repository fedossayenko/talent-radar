This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

* Ignore GEMINI.md and GEMINI-*.md files
* To save main context space, for code searches, inspections, troubleshooting or analysis, use code-searcher subagent where appropriate - giving the subagent full context background for the task(s) you assign it.
* After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
* For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
* Before you finish, please verify your solution
* Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
* NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
* ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
* NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
* When you update or modify core context files, also update markdown documentation and memory bank
* When asked to commit changes, exclude CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE-*.md referenced memory bank system files from any commits. Never delete these files.
* When generate git commit message, avoid message that generated by AI.

* let's concentrate on integration tests. Implement unit tests only when with integration tests it will be complicated, and with unit tests will be much simpler and faster.
* it's still in development, so no need to think about backward capability and we can easily remove all data and start rom scretch
* to start application to check how it works locally let's use docker compose and maintain it, when do critical changes
